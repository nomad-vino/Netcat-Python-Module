h1. Notices

Netcat constructor accepts a third boolean parameter to determine whether errors which occur during open/closing of a socket are throw or handled.  They are thrown if true.  Default is false.

Furthermore, user is responsible for handling possible errors on calling sendall(msg).  An example of how to handle this is shown above.
